# 😷 Face Mask Detection using CNN and OpenCV

A real-time face mask detection system built with **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit**. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not — either from a **webcam** or via **image upload** in a web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time face detection via webcam
- Detects whether face is wearing a **mask** or **no mask**
- Web app using **Streamlit** for easy UI
- Powered by a custom-trained CNN
- Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade for face localization
